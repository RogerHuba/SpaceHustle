        in A+, Net+, Sec+, Linux+, Military Instructor, and I am a graduate 
        of CodeFellows. I am also a life learner having spent over 10 years

        systems with an emphasis on computer forensics, and I hold 2 masters 
        degrees, the first in information systems management, and the second
