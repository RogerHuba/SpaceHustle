Be sure to look at all products and their prices.  Some ports will buy high, some buy low.  Same goes with the selling of products.  In each sector, the menu system will show you what options you have for buying / selling product.

Every time you move to another sector, 1 turn will be deducted.  

Random Events:  Every time you move to a sector, there is a chance for a random event.  Random events range from falling asleep in your chamber and losing turns, to finding an abandon space craft and finding some hols / product to take.
