              As you travel through the universe, you will come across ports that buy or sell different products.  You have 3 types of products in the universe: Fuel, Organics, and Equipment.  You will come across many types of ports.  They will vary for each of the products buying and selling.

              Be sure to look at all products and their prices.  Some ports will buy high, some buy low.  Same goes with the selling of products.  In each sector, the menu system will show you what options you have for buying / selling product.
